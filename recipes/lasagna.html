    <h2>Zoodle Lasagna</h2>
    <p>One day, not having any gluten-free pasta on hand but lots of zucchini, I decided to use 'zoodles' instead of noodles. The whole family enjoyed it!
         I don't use any salt in the recipe because the cheeses already contain it. This dish is even better the next day and freezes well too.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 zucchini</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>

        <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>

        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
            
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or mandolin.</li>

        <li>
            Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, 
            slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.
        </li>

        <li>
            Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 
            1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, 
            about 35 minutes. Allow to set until remaining liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
